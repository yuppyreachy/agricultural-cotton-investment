    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are an agricultural investment foundation focused on the cultivation, sourcing, and international shipping of high-quality cotton. Our mission is simple: to connect agriculture with opportunity by creating sustainable value for farmers, partners, and investors.</p>

    <p>Headquartered in Algeria, with operational branches across Arab countries and the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah), we operate at the intersection of agriculture, global trade, and ethical investment. Through our cross-border cotton supply network, we invest in cotton production and shipping from selected countries and distribute to reliable companies worldwide.</p>

    <p>We offer individuals and institutions the opportunity to invest in cotton-based agricultural projects and earn returns from shared profits. Our model is built on transparency, strategic partnerships, and responsible management of agricultural resources.</p>

    <p>Beyond profitability, we are committed to supporting agricultural development, improving supply chain efficiency, and promoting sustainable farming practices. As global demand for cotton continues to grow, we aim to expand our reach, strengthen our operations, and create long-term value for all stakeholders.</p>

    <p>At our core, we believe agriculture is not just a business—it is a foundation for economic growth, stability, and shared prosperity.</p>
